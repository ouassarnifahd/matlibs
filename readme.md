# Simple math implementations with C

## I. Core Nearly Finished
* Real, Complexe, Real&Complexe Vectors and matrixes.
* Complexe polynomes.
* Complexe fractions (work in progress)
* Tensors (work in progress)

## II. Some useful implementations (work in progress)
* Automatics basics
* Machine Learning basics
* Signal Processing basics

## III. User Interface (work in progress)
* 2Dplot using OpenGL.
